The program was developed using Pycharm 2021.3.1 on Python 3.10. The program also uses Numpy to run random number generation for the creation of points. 

The program can be run as a module with real inputs from the command line. I personally ran the program succesfully in Windows Powershell.

In order to run the program the following command can be used:
python -m SourceCode 

The resulting input and output files (one for Brute Force and one for Divide and Conquer) will be found inside the Inputs/ and Outputs/ folders respectively. These are both inside the SourceCode/ directory. Currently the program runs both methods, therefore the program can run quite slowly for the Brute  Force method on sets of points over 10,000.
