The program was developed using Pycharm 2021.3.1 on Python 3.10. 

The program can be run as a module with real inputs from the command line. I personally ran the program succesfully in Windows Powershell.

In order to run the program the following command can be used:
python -m SourceCode 

The result will be printed into the command line, there will also be an output file generated in the Outputs folder within the SourceCode directory.
